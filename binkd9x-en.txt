    binkd9x is a special binkd version compiled for working in Win9x systems
(Windows 95/98/ME). The fact is that these systems have a documented and
rather an ugly bug in the console subsystem. Because of the bug a console
does not receive any signals (messages) except the keyboard messages
CTRL_C_EVENT and CTRL_BREAK_EVENT. In practice it leads to impossibility
of an automatic binkd shutdown when the OS is shut down or restarted.

    binkd9x is not a console application and it creates a window which
receives the system messages. In fact classic binkd is still working but
without console (in a hidden mode). This is the first disadvantage. At that
none needs a separate binary for Win9x systems. This is the second
disadvantage.

    binkd9x can also work as a service in Win9x systems. Certainly one cannot
compare this mode with the service mode in Windows NT/2000/XP as far as
functionality is concerned but it may be necessary in some cases in Win9x.
For example, if you log off frequently. When binkd9x is installed to work
as a service it is loaded at the system start before anybody logs on and
it does not stop at a logoff.

    Unlike the regular Win32 ("Win32") binkd, binkd9x identifies itself as
"Win9x". However such a behavior may be easily corrected in config.h

    In some situations binkd9x activates a temporary console. Pressing any key
is awaited to close it.

    Distinctions of binkd9x options from the regular Win32 binkd options:

"-T minimize to Tray" is not available in binkd9x since there is nothing
to minimize because of the console absence.

"-v be verbose / dump version and quit", "-h print this help",
undocumented "--help" and also starting binkd9x without arguments activates 
a temporary console before the corresponding action.

    The new options:

"-i       install Win9x service"
 Installs a service.

    The services are written to the registry branch
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices".

    The current path at the moment of binkd9x service installation is also 
written to the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\binkd9x" registry branch.
This path is made current when binkd9x service starts. If binkd9x was
started at the installation from command.com or from a shell (for example, 
from Far) then the binkd9x process command line contains short file name
and short path. If you want to insert the long file name into the registry
during installation then you may use "start" command. For example:
start binkd9x-mingw -i binkd.cfg

    If commands "-i", "-u", "-t" are used binkd9x starts a temporary console.
"-q" option blocks starting the temporary console for all three commands.
At that binkd9x informs its user of important errors using pop-up messages. 
Such a mode is useful mainly for automatic control of services with "-t"
command. If a service installation is successful then binkd9x tries to
start the service.

"-u       UNinstall Win9x service"
 Uninstalls the service. Works similar to the "-i" command. You may uninstall
 all the registered services using "-S name" option with the name "all".
 Example:
1. binkd9x -u        ==> uninstall binkd9x-service
2. binkd9x -u -S Zol ==> uninstall binkd9x-service-Zol
3. binkd9x -u -S all ==> uninstall all binkd9x services


"-t cmd   (start|stop|restart|status|install|uninstall) service(s)"
 It is the command for service control.

 "-t install" installs a service.

    The services are written to the registry branch
 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices".

    The current path at the moment of binkd9x service installation is also 
 written to the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\binkd9x" registry branch.
 This path is made current when binkd9x service starts. If binkd9x was
 started at the installation from command.com or from a shell (for example, 
 from Far) then the binkd9x process command line contains short file name
 and short path. If you want to insert the long file name into the registry
 during installation then you may use "start" command. For example:
 start binkd9x-mingw -t install binkd.cfg

    If commands "-i", "-u", "-t" are used binkd9x starts a temporary console.
 "-q" option blocks starting the temporary console for all three commands.
 At that binkd9x informs its user of important errors using pop-up messages.
 Such a mode is useful mainly for automatic control of services with "-t"
 command. If a service installation is successful then binkd9x tries to
 start the service.

 "-t uninstall" uninstalls the service. Works similar to the "-i" command.
 You may uninstall all the registered services using "-S name" option with
 the name "all".
 Example:
 1. binkd9x -u        ==> uninstall binkd9x-service
 2. binkd9x -u -S Zol ==> uninstall binkd9x-service-Zol
 3. binkd9x -u -S all ==> uninstall all binkd9x services


 "-t status" shows the status of binkd9x services in registry.
 "-t start" starts services.
 "-t stop" stops services.
 "-t restart" restarts services.

    On default all actions refer to "binkd9x-service". You may indicate the 
service name using "-S name" option. If you indicate "all" instead of the
service name then the operation is done to all services registered in the
system registry.

    There is no much sense in using "-q" option with "-t status" command.

 Example:
1. binkd9x -t status    ==> Prints the status of the binkd9x-service
2. binkd9x -t status -S local
                        ==> Prints the status of the binkd9x-service-local
3. binkd9x -t status -S all
                        ==> Prints the status of all registered services
4. binkd9x -t status -S all -q
                        ==> see 2., but there is no practical sense in it
                            (there is no console)
5. binkd9x -t start     ==> Starts binkd9x-service, if it has not been started
6. binkd9x -t start -S local
                        ==> see 5., but for binkd9x-service-local
7. binkd9x -t start -S all
                        ==> see 5., but for all services
9. binkd9x -t start -q  ==> см. 5., but does not create console (it is
                            convinient for using in scripts or bat-files).
10. binkd9x -t stop -q  ==> similar to 9., but the service is stopped.
 ... and so on...

"-S name  set Win9x service name, all - use all services"
 It indicates the name of the service with which "-t" command will work. The 
 service real name which is written to registry is built in the following way:
 "binkd9x-service[-name]", where "binkd9x-service" is the compulsory part,
 and "-name" is appended if "-S name" is present. For all commands except
 "-t install" special service name "all" is allowed. In this case the indicated
 operation will be done to all installed services. If you indicate 
 "binkd9x-service" or "binkd9x-service-*" as a service name then the service
 name will be used as is, without prepending an additional "binkd9x-service"
 prefix. Examples:

1. binkd9x -t install binkd.cfg                    ==> binkd9x-service
2. binkd9x -t install -S local binkd.cfg           ==> binkd9x-service-local
3. binkd9x -t install -S binkd9x-service binkd.cfg ==> binkd9x-service
4. binkd9x -t install -S binkd9x-service-local binkd.cfg
                                                   ==> binkd9x-service-local
5. binkd9x -t status -S all                        ==> status of all installed
                                                        services is printed

How to make binkd9x:

    At present binkd9x is compiled with the help of MSVC and MinGW.
The technology is practically the same as for the regular binkd.

    For MSVC it is only necessary to indicate "BINKD9X" macro for using with 
nmake, for instance:
 1. nmake BINKD9X=1                          ==> makes binkd9x with the
                                                 Release configuration
 2. nmake BINKD9X=1 DEBUG=1                  ==> makes binkd9x with the
                                                 Debug configuration
 3. nmake BINKD9X=1 STATIC=1                 ==> makes binkd9x using static
                                                 RTL library

    For MinGW it is similar:
 make BINKD9X=1

    ATTENTION! If you alternately compile binkd and binkd9x using MinGW then
it is necessary to "make clean" or to manually delete *.o, nt/*.o and
ntlm/*.o files. If you do not do it compilation errors or improper work
of binkd and binkd9x is possible.

    I shall be glad, if binkd9x come in useful to anybody besides me.
