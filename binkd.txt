NAME
       binkd - transfer files between two Fidonet systems over TCP/IP

SYNOPSIS
       binkd [-CcDipqrsvmh] [ -P node ] config-file

DESCRIPTION
       Binkd is a Fidonet mailer designed to operate via TCP/IP networks. As a
       FTN-compatible internet daemon, it makes possible efficient utilization
       of  TCP/IP protocol suite as a transport layer in FTN-based (Fido Tech-
       nology Network) networks.

       Binkd expects your spool for Fido-like networks to  be  in  BSO  ("Bink
       style outbound") or optionaly ASO ("Amiga style outbound") format.  BSO
       is also used by ifmail and BinkleyTerm mailers.


OPTIONS
       -C     Binkd running with this option  will  reread  the  configuration
              file  if  it is changed. The modification time of the configura-
              tion file is checked every 60 seconds and on every incoming  and
              outgoing connection.

       -c     Start client only. Normally Binkd starts both server and client.

       -D     Run Binkd as a daemon (cannot be used for client-only mode).

       -i     Run Binkd from inetd.

       -P     Poll a node.  An empty *.ilo file in the outbound will  be  cre-
              ated,  which  will force Binkd to connect to and to receive mail
              from the node ( Binkd will also add "Node node *  -"  record  to
              the  table-of-nodes  in Binkd 's memory if there is no entry for
              the node in the configuration file).

       -p     Start client manager, process polls, quit if the queue seems  to
              be empty after the next rescan. Implies -c.

       -q     Quiet  mode. Turns off printq, conlog and percents statements of
              configuration.

       -r     Disable crypt traffic.

       -s     Start server only. Normally Binkd starts both server and client.

       -v     Be  verbose.  This flag can be specified multiple times for even
              higher verbosity.  Binkd -v will dump binkd's version and  quit.
              Binkd  -vvv  binkd.cfg will dump binkd's configuration and still
              work.

       -m     Disable CRAM-MD5 authorization. Implies -r.

       -n     doing not call or listen (only check cfg and make polls)

       -h     Print help message.


SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Causes Binkd to reload it's config.
